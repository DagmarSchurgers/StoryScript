        You come upon a green tent, embroidered with golden images of flowers and woodland animals. From the tent, a strong scent of herbs and spices reaches you. You can
        hear someone softly singing inside.

    </p>
    <p>
        As you approach the tent, the singing stops, and moments later, a young woman emerges from the tent. The woman is quite beautiful, with a long braid of golden hair
        falling across her shoulder, and radiant blue eyes. She is clad in a plain green dress, with a sturdy leather belt around her waist, from which hang several small
        pouches. The woman smiles as she sees you.

    </p>
    <p>

        ‘Hello there. I haven’t seen you here before. Are you in need of healing? Or perhaps some potions?’
        The voice of the woman is soft and warm.
        ‘I am Siri, the druidess. And you are a warrior in the tournament, I recognize you know. I am most pleased to meet you. If I can help you with anything, please let
        me know.’

        As you come upon the healers tent, you hear singing coming from within. Then, the singing stops, and you hear the friendly voice of Siri.
    </p>
    <p>

        ‘Warrior, I have been expecting you. Please, come in.’
    </p>
    <p>
        You enter the tent and see Siri stirring something in a large bowl of water on a stone pedestal. The air in her tent is warm and filled with the scents of spices
        and herbs.  Herbs hang down from the ceiling of the tent, and are stored in jars and small pots upon wooden tables. Sunlight falls in through small circular
        windows in the fabric of the tent, falling in golden beams across a tapestry of blue and green that covers the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you enter, Siri turns towards you and smiles brightly. Her smile is quite radiant, rivalling the golden beams of sunlight.
        ‘Welcome, warrior. I saw you fight yesterday. I was worried for you more than once, but you won the day with bravery. It must be quite exciting to stand in
        the midst of battle, as you do. But please, how may I aid you?’

    <p>
        As you come upon Siri’s tent, you see her sitting outside in the grass. She has crossed her legs beneath her, her hands rest on her hips and she
        has closed her eyes. A great calm emenates from her.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you approach, she slowly opens her eyes. There is something strange about her eyes, a silver fog seems to cloud them, a flowing, whirling fog. A silver
        maelstrom, pulling you in, drawing you towards its depths, towards a place beyond this world.
        But then, the fog starts to clear from her eyes, and her eyes become clear and blue again. Siri seems to awaken from a deep slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Hi my friend, I did not see you there.’
        Siri smiles at you. But then, her smile fades.
        ‘But I did see you. In the great weave. I felt your presence, and I felt the godess watching over you. And I saw many strands of the great weave come together
        where you where, many futures, many possibilities.’
        Siri falls silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘You have a part to play in the future, my friend, a most important part. But what it is, I cannot say.’
        Siri smiles.
        ‘But don’t be burdened by it, the godess watches over you, and her power is vast. Now, how may I help you?’
