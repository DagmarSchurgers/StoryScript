        You have watched several bands of warriors take to the field. Experienced veterans of war, and young men clearly fighting their very first battle. Victors have
        emerged and warriors have been struck down and defeated, all to the cheers and applause of the great crowd surrounding the field.
        Now, it is your turn to fight, your first battle of the tournament.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your first opponent emerges from a simple, brown tent and enters the field. He doesn't appear too threathening, a farmboy, by the looks of it, carrying an old
        sword and shield which have seen better days. But the sword appears to have been recently polished and sharpened, and the shield reinforced. The young man, brown
        haired and blue eyed, looks healthy and strong.

    <p>
        As the young man takes to the field, the farmers and craftsmen amongst the spectators cheer and whistle merrily, while some of the nobleman and rich merchants
        look at them with scorn and disdain. The young man steps forward and adresses you.
        'Greetings, warrior. I wish you a good fight, and may the best of us win.'
        With that, the young man readies his weapon.

        On the great wooden stage at the far end of the field,  decorated with shields and banners, from where king Valdemar himself views the fighting, the king’s steward
        rises. He holds out a wooden rod, and then casts it unto the field.
        The sign that battle has begun

        The young man, enthousiastic and strong as he may be, is no match for your skill and prowess. As his strength falthers, and he is forced relentlessly back, this
        realisation begins to dawn upon him. But still the young man holds the field and refuses to give up.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is only after you land a mighty blow, that splinters his shield into a thousand pieces, that he raises his hand.
        'Stop. Enough. You have beaten me. I surrender to your might.'
        As you nod in approval, the spectators rise from their benches and give you a long and enthousiastic applause. The first victory of the day is yours. From the
        wooden stage the king’s steward descends, and walks towards you.
        ‘Well done, warrior. Here is your reward for your first victory.’
        The steward hands you a leather pouch, containing 5 gold coins.
