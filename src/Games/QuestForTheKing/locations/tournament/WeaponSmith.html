    You come upon a large brown tent of thick leather. From a improvised chimney, columns of thick black smoke rise up. From the inside of the tent comes the sound of 
    a loud clanging and banging, of hammering, the sizzling of hot steel and the wheezing of bellows. A great heat emanates from the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you approach, the noises stop, and from the opening of the tent appears a large, burly man, clad in a leather apron stained with sooth and ash. The man has a black
        beard and moustache and brown eyes with which he looks at you curiously.
</p>
    <p>
        ‘Ah, you must be that young adventurer. I have heard about you. It seems you have great skill for a youngster such as yourself.’
        The man smiles merrily.
        ‘Well, I wish you all the best in the tournament. If you need weapons or armor, or some repairs done, come visit me.’
        The man sits down upon a wooden stool in front of the tent and takes a pipe from one of the pockets of his apron.
        ‘My name is Bjarni by the way, glad to have met you.

        As you arrive at the tent, you see Bjarni sitting on his wooden stool smoking his pipe. He is busy inspecting the blade of a long dagger, resting on his lap.
        As he sees you approach, he tucks the dagger away in his belt and rises to meet you with a friendly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Hello there, youngster. I saw you do battle yesterday. What a great fight it was, you are a fine warrior indeed.’
        Bjarni takes a long puff of his pipe.
        ‘But even the finest warrior is nothing without his weapon or armour, is that not so? And I would be pleased to help you with that in any way I can.’

        As you arrive at the tent, you see Bjarni talking to two royal officers.  The officers seem to be asking him several questions, to which Bjarni replies
        by shaking his head and raising his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a moment, the officers take their leave, and Bjarni turns towards you.
        ‘Ah, friend, good you are here. Seems there has been some excitement last night. They have found the bodies of two men. Assassins, it would seem. At least,
        that is what the officers told me.’
        Bjarni looks at you with interest.
        ‘But what they where after, has apparently got the better of them. At any rate, good riddance to the scum I say. Now, how can I help you?’
