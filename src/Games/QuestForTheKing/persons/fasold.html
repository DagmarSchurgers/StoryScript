			The gods, travelers, you wish to know more about the gods of Idunia? Please, allow me to enlighten you. 
		   </p>
		   <p>
			   Of course, the gods of the old country are worshiped, such as Odin, Tyr and Freya. But also gods that where revered long before the warriors
			   of king Vali made landfall. Or rather, goddesses I should say, for the native peoples of Idunia revere three goddesses, sacred sisters, as 
			   they are called. The Sister of the Sea, the Sister of the Sky and the Sister of the moon.

			The sister of the sky is the chief goddess, the Life bringer, she is called. She brings the rain and the sunlight, and is kind-hearted and 
			benevolent. But if her anger is incurred, she becomes the goddess of raging winds and whipping rains, of thunder and lightning.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sister of the sky is depicted as a beautiful young woman in a white dress, embellished with golden beams like the rays of the sun, 
			or as a warrior maiden in golden armour. 
			She has long blond hair and blue eyes, blue as the clearest sky on a summer's day. She is often depicted sitting on a throne of silvery 
			clouds, with next to her a huge griffin, with radiant golden feathers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sister of the sky is the eldest of the three sisters, and the other sisters obey her commands. The sister of the sea has been known to 
			rebel against her sister however, and follow her own path, regardless of the wishes of her eldest sister.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sister of the sky is revered by farmers, shepherds, and all that work the land. She has a special shrine in the province of Aifor, 
			where the female druids hold special celebrations and ceremonies in her honor.

			The sister of the sea is a fickle goddess, or so I have heard. Sometimes kind and gentle, but also tempestuous and wild, and vengeful 
			against any who have offended her. An elusive goddess, it is said, as fathomless as the deepest sea.
		</p>
		<p>
			The people who worship her, fisherman and merchants, try to gain her favor before they sail, offering her incense and precious stones,
			which they send out unto the sea upon small boats made of parchment. But all sailors know the temper of the sister of the sea is fickle,
			and can easily shift and change.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sister of the sea is depicted as a pale but beautiful young woman, clad in a blue dress with a pattern of fish scales, adorned with white
			shells. She has long green curls, and misty eyes, like the fog upon the sea.
			She sits on a throne of red coral, and around the throne lie the coils of a huge sea dragon. The dragon is blue scaled, and has silvery manes
			like that of a lion. It is said the dragon is the messenger and companion of the sister of the sea.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mariners sometimes claim to have seen the dragon, coiling in the depths of great whirlpools, or in the foam of huge waves of an especially
			tempestuous sea. The dragon itself is also revered, but as a minor deity.

			The sister of the moon is the youngest of the three sacred sisters, and the most enigmatic. Worshipers of the moon goddess are usually 
			wizards, magicians and soothsayers. But she is also revered amongst those who make a living in the shadows, thieves, rogues and other 
			persons of questionable morality.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sister of the moon is neutral in such matters, it is said, and has an agenda of her own. She is the youngest of the three sisters and 
			has the smallest domain. As such, her sisters sometimes treat her in a patronizing manner, but she is much more than she appears.
			I have been told the moon sister communicates with her worshipers through rays of moonlight, in which a soft whisper can be heard, for 
			those who hear and listen. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The sister of the moon is depicted as a beautiful young woman with a finely chiseled face. Her black hair is bound together at the back of 
			her head, and held fast with silvery pins. She is dressed in a long, silvery dress, embroidered with images of the moon and stars, with a 
			broad blue sash around her waist. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I have heard a rumor that there is an order of female warriors fiercely loyal to the moon sister. Strange stories are told about the order, 
			that the female members are not human, not anymore, that they have crossed into a shadowy existence. But most stories connect the order with
			acts of protection and vigilance, and the death of those who would harm the innocent in a most gruesome manner. Gruesome, I must say, for it
			appears that, when they where found, all their blood had been mysteriously drained from their bodies.
		</p>
		<p>
			The moon sister is a mystery, and I have to say, that she is the goddess that intrigues me the most.

			It is said there are other sacred sisters, lesser deities, revered in the depths of the forests, on isolated islands, in the shadows 
			of mountains. But I have not yet discovered the name of a single one, or any of their worshipers.

			Ah, you wish to know about the kingdom of Idunia? Please, allow me to enlighten you.
		</p>
			I have traveled through all of the provinces of the kingdom, and have spoken with noblemen, princes and princesses, dukes and duchesses. 
			But also with farmers and craftsmen, soldiers and monks. And I have written down my impressions, my adventures and experiences, in hopes 
			that others may benefit from it. Adventurers like you, for example, and it would be my honor to tell you about our great kingdom.

	<node name="aifor">
		<p>
			The oldest and first province of the kingdom of Idunia is the province of Aifor. It is the province where the forefathers of king Vali 
			went ashore. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The province of Aifor consists largely of pine woods. Villages are scattered and far apart, and keep contact with signal fires that are lit 
			on the hills within the forest, and with trained falcons, which carry messages with speed. As such, falconers are viewed with great respect 
			in Aifor, as many villagers depend on them for messages from their relatives.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aifor is ruled by duke Erland, a closed, absent minded man. A dreamer, it is said, whose thoughts are more with his books than his province.
			The daily matters of the province are therefore handled by his wife, the countess Thyra, the most beautiful women of the kingdom, it is said.
			The countess Thyra is also the leader of a group of female druids, who worship the forest goddess Embla.
			The druids are aided, it is said, by mesmerizing dryads and nymphs of the woods, and their rituals take place in the deepest, most confined
			spaces of the forest.

			Gelandri is the province of the best warriors of the kingdom. Not anywhere is martial prowess and courage so highly valued as among the 
			people of Gelandri. They worship their ancestors, the Norse warriors who established the kingdom of Idunia, and Tyr, the god of war. 
			A great wooden statue of Tyr is located in the heart of the province.
		</p>
		<p>
			The people of Gelandri value their honor most highly, and an attack upon their honor, be it real or imagined, is met with the fiercest of 
			reactions, as I myself have had the opportunity to witness firsthand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Duels are frequent in Gelandri, but most of them just for sport or entertainment. And I myself have been challenged to a friendly duel more 
			then once, but I could always excuse myself by pointing to my advancing years.

			The most important province of the kingdom is the province of Idunia. It is a beautiful, prosperous province, with green meadows and fertile 
			fields covered with golden cornstalks, of which is baked the finest bread in the entire kingdom. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The royal city is a sight to behold. It is always buzzing with activity, you can witness silversmiths at work, armorers, bookbinders, 
			alchemists, and countless other craftsmen who weave, smith, paint and sculpt. The royal city houses the famous gild of royal adventures, the
			members of which are all seasoned warriors and heroes, and are often send on secret, dangerous missions, and on quests and voyages of 
			discovery.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the heart of the city lies the royal palace, from which king Valdemar, together with his counselors, rules the kingdom. Next to the 
			palace is the Temple of the Eternal Spring. It is said that the water of the spring grants visions and mystical powers. The priestesses of 
			the temple advice the king about the future, and are the only ones to be allowed to drink the springs water.
			Finally, the royal city houses the fortress of the royal army, decorated with shields and flags waving in the wind.
		</p>
		<p>
			In case of a threat to the kingdom, the experienced soldiers of king Valdemar will protect the kingdom and its inhabitants.

		<p>
			The province of Lysa is largely covered with swamps. I have been there only a few times myself, but I always been surprised by the peace and 
			contentment of the people, even though Lysa is the poorest province of the kingdom.
			It is said, that the peace and quiet of the people also stems from a certain swamp root, that is consumed in great quantities, and appears 
			to bring about a particular state of mind. But I have never been able to verify this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lysa is ruled by the countess Ruzena. A mysterious woman, beautiful, but cold blooded and opaque, like the water of the swamps. Elusive, 
			it is said, like the mists that cover the swamps of Lysa for a great part of the year. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The countess has a reputation of friendliness and kindness to her subjects, but no one exactly knows what drives her, and some suspect her 
			of more sinister motivations. Her castle, to be sure, is a sight to behold. It is build from blue, transparent stone, a sort of glassy rock,
			that is only dug up in Lysa, and glitters and shines in the rays of the sun.

	<node name="ravendal">
		<p>
			The province of Ravendal is largely abandoned, laid to waste in the great war of king Valdemar against the Wizard, and the mountain barons 
			who had chosen his side. Ravendal consists of mountains and valleys. Ruins of castles and burned down villages still recall the war and the 
			price paid by the people. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The people still living in Ravendal move around in covered wagons and live off hunting and the crafting of woodwork and silver, in which 
			they are especially talented. Now and again, the people of Ravendal gather in valleys and fields and light great fires, around which they 
			dance and sing until the first morning light.
		</p>
		<p>
			The people of Ravendal refuse to feel themselves bound by the laws of the land, and their loyalty to the king is questionable at best. Like 
			their brothers and sisters of Sandfell, the people are hot tempered, emotional and very loyal to their group, but distrustful of outsiders. 
			The influence of the crown in Ravendal is limited, and comes particularly from the royal garrison, stationed  in a great fort near the border 
			with the province of Idunia.

	<node name="sandfell">
		<p>
			Sandfell is the sister province of the province of Ravendal. To the east, it borders the great desert, and it is the staging point for 
			caravans heading towards the realm of sultan Mehmet the Magnificent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sandfell is a rugged province, with high mountains, dark mountain valley's, mysterious forest and icy mountain streams. The people of 
			Sandfell make a living herding sheep and tending small acres of land. There are also some gold and iron mines, but the proceeds of these 
			mines is largely claimed by the crown.
		</p>
		<p>
			The people are generally surly and distrustful of outsiders, but fiercely loyal to each other, and capable of great outbursts of emotion. 
			They are known for their enchanting music, the notes of which are as quick as fireflies, dancing in the night. They wear colorful clothing 
			and their women adorn themselves with graceful bracelets and anklets.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sandfell is ruled by the sons and daughters of the mountain barons who have been killed in the great war against king Valdemar. Sandfell is
			viewed with distrust in the other provinces, and many expect that the province of Sandfell will in the future, rise once more in rebellion.
