<description display-name="A clearing between the trees">
    <p>
        Moving slowly towards the clearing, you gather that there must be something there to explain the dim light you're seeing. But however hard you try,
        you cannot remember more about why you're here right now. Maybe seeing what's there will refresh your memory.

        After two more steps, you freeze. You hear something moving behind you in the foliage. As you turn around carefully, you make out shapes between the trees.
        The shapes resembly dogs, but bigger. Just before you realize what is going on, you hear a horse calling out in terror. Just in time you step back, avoiding
        the horse galloping past you within inches.

        With the horse out of the way, you now stare at two big creatures which must be wolves. Strangely though, their eyes seem to be red. Looking around in fear,
        you spot something near your feet that looks like metal. You could try and grab it, though you have a hard time controlling your urge to run away.
