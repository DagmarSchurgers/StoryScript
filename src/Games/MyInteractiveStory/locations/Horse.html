        You take a few steps towards the horse, but then trip over what is perhaps a root and fall towards the animal. With effort, you manage to grab
        a bridle. The horse is disturbed and pulls back it's head, putting you back on your feet with force. There is a flash of pain in your back, but before
        you really notice it you make out a number of red eyes between the dark trees.
