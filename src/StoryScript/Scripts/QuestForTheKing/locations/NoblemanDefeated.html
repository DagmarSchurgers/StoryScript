        The young nobleman lies defeated upon the field. The spectators rise from their benches and give you a long and enthousiastic applause. Only some noblemen from
        Lysa remain silent.
        From the wooden stage the king’s steward descends, and walks towards you.
        ‘Well done, warrior. Here is your reward for your second victory.’
        The steward hands you a leather pouch, containing 15 gold coins.
