        You come upon a green tent, embroidered with golden images of flowers and woodland animals. From the tent, a strong scent of herbs and spices reaches you. You can 
        hear someone softly singing inside.

    </p>

    As you approach the tent, the singing stops, and moments later, a young woman emerges from the tent. The woman is quite beautiful, with a long braid of golden hair 
    falling across her shoulder, and radiant blue eyes. She is clad in a plain green dress, with a sturdy leather belt around her waist, from which hang several small 
    pouches. The woman smiles as she sees you.

    <p>

    ‘Hello there. I haven’t seen you here before. Are you in need of healing? Or perhaps some potions?’
    The voice of the woman is soft and warm.
    ‘I am Siri, the druidess. And you are a warrior in the tournament, I recognize you know. I am most pleased to meet you. If I can help you with anything, please let
    me know.’
