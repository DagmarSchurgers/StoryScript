    It is the third day of the tournament. The list of entrants is thinning rapidly, only a few bands of warriors are left. Although the experience of the 
    previous night has left you a bit shaken, you rise with determination to fight, and win the day.

    Upon the tournament field, the spectators have already taken their place upon the benches. Among them, one rises up and waves enthousiastically at you. You 
    recognize Bjarni, and next to him, looking up to him and smiling, sits Siri. She turns her eyes to you and raises her hand in greetings.
    But then, your opponents enter the field.

    Your next opponent emerges from a blue silken tent, embroidered with intricate designs in a silver thread.  You see an attractive young women take to the field, 
    clad in a partial plate mail and a silver, winged helm. In her hands she holds a spears and wooden shield. Clearly, the woman is a shieldmaiden from the 
    Valkyrian order.

    As the shieldmaiden strides unto the field, she looks looks at you inquisitively with radiant blue eyes. She is quite beautiful, with long golden hair falling down 
    from under her helmet. She takes a short bow before you.
    ‘I salute you, brother. May Odin bless us all and the Valkyries watch over our duel.’
    Her voice is soft but with a firmness and determination to it. She will undoubtedly be a strong adversary.

    <p>

    On the great wooden stage the king's steward rises, and casts the wooden rod upon the field. Your second battle has begun.
