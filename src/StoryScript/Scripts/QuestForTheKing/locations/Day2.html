        It is the second day of the tournament. Many would-be warriors and inexperienced participants have been defeated and carried off the field, amidst praises and
        cheers for the victors. Now, it is your turn again to do battle.

        From a richly decorated tent, your second opponent emerges and walks unto the field. It is a young nobleman from Lysa, clad in chainmail and carrying a longsword.
        The nobleman steps forward and adresses you. He has a blond moustache and blue eyes, with which he looks at you disdainfully.

        ‘What’s this?’ the young man speaks haughtily.
        ‘I had expected more then such rabble.’
        The young nobleman seems overly confident, but not very experienced.

        On the great wooden stage the king's steward rises, and casts the wooden rod upon the field. Your second battle has begun.

        The young nobleman lies defeated upon the field. The spectators rise from their benches and give you a long and enthousiastic applause. Only some noblemen from
        Lysa remain silent.
        From the wooden stage the king’s steward descends, and walks towards you.
        ‘Well done, warrior. Here is your reward for your second victory.’
        The steward hands you a leather pouch, containing 15 gold coins.
