     It is the second day of the tournament. Many would-be warriors and inexperienced participants have been defeated and carried off the field, amidst praises and 
     cheers for the victors. Now, it is your turn again to do battle.

    From a richly decorated tent, your second opponent emerges and walks unto the field. It is a young nobleman from Lysa, clad in chainmail and carrying a longsword.
    The nobleman steps forward and adresses you. He has a blond moustache and blue eyes, with which he looks at you disdainfully.

    ‘What’s this?’ the young man speaks haughtily.
    ‘I had expected more then such rabble.’
    The young nobleman seems overly confident, but not very experienced.

    On the great wooden stage the king's steward rises, and casts the wooden rod upon the field. Your second battle has begun.
