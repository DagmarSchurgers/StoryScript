    The young woman falls back before your might. Her shield is splinterd, her spear on the verge of breaking and her armor is cut in several places. 
    As you make ready for your next attack, she suddenly raises her spear to the sky, and then lays it carefully on the ground. She gives you a respectful nod.
    'You have defeated me, brother,' she speaks softly.
    ‘You clearly are a great warrior, and Odin has blessed you.’

    and enthousiastic applause.

    From the wooden stage the king’s steward descends, and walks towards you.
    ‘A fine performance, warrior. Here is your reward for your third victory.’
    The steward hands you a leather pouch, containing 30 gold coins.
