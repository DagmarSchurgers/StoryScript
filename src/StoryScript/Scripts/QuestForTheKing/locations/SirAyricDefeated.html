    Before you, Sir Ayric lies motionless upon the field. His helment lies broken on the grass, and blood trickles down his face.  But you are sure he will live, 
    and perhaps, respect your victory.
    The spectators, who have watched your battle with deep silence, only broken now and then by their cries of awe and disbelief at the sight of the great knight 
    losing his ground to an unknown warrior, now erupt in deafening cheers and applause.

    From the wooden stage at the far end of the field, the king’ steward motions you to come forward. As you walk towards the stage, king Valdemar rises from his throne, 
    and a great silence descends upon the tournament grounds.
    ‘Warrior,’ speaks the king with a strong, resounding voice.
    ‘You have proven yourself the best of all candidates. You have fought with strength and bravery. With honour you have gained this victory.  Now, I proclaim you Royal
    Adventurer.’

    From the spectators, a loud cheering erupts. The people applaud, whistle and cheer, and seem very happy with your victory. You spot the farmboy and the shieldmaiden 
    among them, who give you a respectful nod.
    The king smiles, and raises his hand in salute.
    ‘Rest now, adventurer’ speaks the king.
    ‘And return here tonight, for we will hold a great feast in your honour.’
