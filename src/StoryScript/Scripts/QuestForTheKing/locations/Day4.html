     It is the fourth day of the tournament. The final day. Only two bands of warriors remain, the last two contestants for the titles of Royal Adventurer.
     The spectators are quite excited, a great murmur rising from their benches. Bjarni is there, waving at you, and Siri, dressed in a beautiful gown of gold, 
     decorated with silver leaves.

    From a green tent embroidered with a large silver wolf, the emblem of the kingdom of Idunia, emerges your last opponents. Sir Ayric, one of the royal guards, 
    a large man well known for his strength and prowess with the battleaxe.

    Sir Ayric walks unto the field in full armour, amidst cheers from the spectators and salutes from the tournament guards.

    Sir Ayric positions himself before you, and opens the visor of his helmet.
    ‘Greetings, young one. You have fought well. ‘
    His voice is friendly, but with a patronising undertone.
    ‘But now, you are clearly outmatched. There would be no shame in withdrawing from the tournament, and leave the title to your betters.’

    <p>

    As the knight sees that you are not about to give up so easily, his face hardens.
    ‘Very well. A lesson is clearly in order.’
    With a snarl, sir Ayric closes the visor of his helmet and raises his battleaxe.
