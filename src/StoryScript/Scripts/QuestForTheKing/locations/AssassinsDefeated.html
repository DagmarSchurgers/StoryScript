    The shadowy figures lie defeated before you. They wear black leather clothes, their faces hidden behind black scarves. The daggers that lie in their now 
    lifeless hands have a wavy blade and seem coated with a strange substance.

    You may take the Daggers (you gain two Poison Daggers).

    You may search the Assassins.

    <p>

    As you search the assassins, you find an expensive looking piece of parchment, folded neatly in two. As you open it, you see it is a letter, written in 
    flowing elegant letters. The letter reads:

    </p>

    ‘Your mission is this. Enter the tournament grounds at night. Find the warrior the master has warned us about, and destroy him. He must not be
    allowed to live. The master commands it.’
    The letter is unsigned.

    <p>

    A further search of the assassins reveals a concealed leather pouch, holding 25 golden coins.

    </p>

    As you complete your search of the strange men, you decide that leaving them dead in your tent would cause some questions to be raised.
    With effort, you take up the men, and carry them swiftly and silently out of your tent, and to the edge of the tournament field, where you hide their bodies in the 
    thick underbrush.

    <p>
