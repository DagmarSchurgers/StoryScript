    You have retired to your tent to sleep until the next day, when the third day of the tournament awaits you. You fall quickly asleep.

    </p>

    Suddenly, a noise awakens you. Something of a branch cracking beneath a boot. All is dark around you, the only light comes from a faint ray of moonlight, falling in 
    through the opening of your tent. You hear a muffled sound. Then, a whispering voice.

    <p>

    ‘Damn you. If he has heard us, the mission is lost. Come now, quick and quiet.’
    Slowly, the flap of your tent is moved aside. The moonlight illuminates two shadowy figures, holding long daggers.
    You have just the time to rise and reach for your weapons, before the figures move swiftly towards you. Battle begins!
