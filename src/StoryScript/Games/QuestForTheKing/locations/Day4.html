     It is the fourth day of the tournament. The final day. Only two bands of warriors remain, the last two contestants for the titles of Royal Adventurer.
     The spectators are quite excited, a great murmur rising from their benches. Bjarni is there, waving at you, and Siri, dressed in a beautiful gown of gold, 
     decorated with silver leaves.

    From a green tent embroidered with a large silver wolf, the emblem of the kingdom of Idunia, emerges your last opponents. Sir Ayric, one of the royal guards, 
    a large man well known for his strength and prowess with the battleaxe.

    Sir Ayric walks unto the field in full armour, amidst cheers from the spectators and salutes from the tournament guards.

    Sir Ayric positions himself before you, and opens the visor of his helmet. The knight has grey eyes and a large battle scar on his right cheek.
    ‘Greetings, young one. You have fought well. ‘
    His voice is friendly, but with a patronising undertone.
    ‘But now, you are clearly outmatched. There would be no shame in withdrawing from the tournament, and leave the title to your betters.’

    <p>

    As the knight sees that you are not about to give up so easily, his face hardens.
    ‘Very well. A lesson is clearly in order.’
    With a snarl, sir Ayric closes the visor of his helmet and raises his battleaxe.

        Before you, Sir Ayric lies motionless upon the field. His helment lies broken on the grass, and blood trickles down his face.  But you are sure he will live,
        and perhaps, respect your victory.
        The spectators, who have watched your battle with deep silence, only broken now and then by their cries of awe and disbelief at the sight of the great knight
        losing his ground to an unknown warrior, now erupt in deafening cheers and applause.

        From the wooden stage at the far end of the field, the king’ steward motions you to come forward. As you walk towards the stage, king Valdemar rises from his throne,
        and a great silence descends upon the tournament grounds.
        ‘Warrior,’ speaks the king with a strong, resounding voice.
        ‘You have proven yourself the best of all candidates. You have fought with strength and bravery. With honour you have gained this victory.  Now, I proclaim you Royal
        Adventurer.’

    </p>
    <p>
        From the spectators, a loud cheering erupts. The people applaud, whistle and cheer, and seem very happy with your victory. You spot the farmboy and the shieldmaiden
        among them, who give you a respectful nod.
        The king smiles, and raises his hand in salute.
        ‘Rest now, adventurer’ speaks the king.
        ‘And return here tonight, for we will hold a great feast in your honour.’
