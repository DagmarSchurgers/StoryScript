        You come upon a quiet forest lake. Moonlight glistens on its surface, and a nightly breeze stirs the water into ripples and waves.
        In the centre of the lake lies a small green island. Several weathered stepping stones lead towards the island.

        In the middle of the island stands a stone statue. It appears to be the statue of a woman. Beautifully carved, the woman seems almost alive.
        She is clad in a flowing gown, finely chiselled curls fall down her face and shoulders. She seems to smile, but you cannot be sure.

        You feel irresistibly drawn towards the statue. As you approach it, you see something glitter around the neck of the statue. It appears to 
        be a golden necklace. Your hand moves almost out of itself towards the necklace. As you do so, you can hear a strange whisper in your 
        thoughts. A barely audible voice, silvery, like the moonlight.
        ‘Take my necklace. And use it well.’

        For a moment, you could swear the statue was very much alive.
