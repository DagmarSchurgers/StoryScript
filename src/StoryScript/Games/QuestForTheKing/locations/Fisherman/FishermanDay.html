        Before you lies a sandy beach, and beyond the beach, a vast blue ocean. Ocean waves break gently upon the sand. High above the ocean 
        seagulls fly, screeching and occasionally diving down towards the surface.
        Not far from the edge of the forest, you can see a small cottage. It is raised from the beach on sturdy wooden posts. A wooden porch 
        extends from the cottage across the beach, and into the sea as a short pier.

        On the porch sits an old man in a wooden chair, mending a fishing net. The man is clad in a thick woollen jumper and brown leather trousers.
        A well kept grey beard and moustache adorn his face. As you approach, the old man looks at you with an irritated glance.
        ‘What is this’ he speaks with a gruff, raspy voice.
        ‘More landlubbers to bother me.’ The man frowns darkly.
        ‘You be wanting my boat, yes? They all want that.’

        The fisherman points a thumb toward the peer. At the end of it you can spot a small fishing boat.
        ‘Well, you can forget it, it isn’t for sale’ the fisherman continues.
        ‘I rent it out, is what I do. 20 gold coins up front. You’ll get 10 back when you return my boat in one piece.’
