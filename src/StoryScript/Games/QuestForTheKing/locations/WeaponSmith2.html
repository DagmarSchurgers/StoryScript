     As you arrive at the tent, you see Bjarni sitting on his wooden stool smoking his pipe. He is busy inspecting the blade of a long dagger, resting on his lap.
     As he sees you approach, he tucks the dagger away in his belt and rises to meet you with a friendly smile.

    ‘Hello there, youngster. I saw you do battle yesterday. What a great fight it was, you are a fine warrior indeed.’
     Bjarni takes a long puff of his pipe.
    ‘But even the finest warrior is nothing without his weapon or armour, is that not so? And I would be pleased to help you with that in any way I can.’
