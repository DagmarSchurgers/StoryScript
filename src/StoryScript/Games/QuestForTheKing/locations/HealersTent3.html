     As you come upon Siri’s tent, you see her sitting outside in the grass. She has crossed her legs beneath her, her hands rest on her hips and she 
     has closed her eyes. A great calm emenates from her.
 </p>
    <p>
        As you approach, she slowly opens her eyes. There is something strange about her eyes, a silver fog seems to cloud them, a flowing, whirling fog. A silver
        maelstrom, pulling you in, drawing you towards its depths, towards a place beyond this world.
        But then, the fog starts to clear from her eyes, and her eyes become clear and blue again. Siri seems to awaken from a deep slumber.
</p>
    <p>
        ‘Hi my friend, I did not see you there.’
        Siri smiles at you. But then, her smile fades.
        ‘But I did see you. In the great weave. I felt your presence, and I felt the godess watching over you. And I saw many strands of the great weave come together
        where you where, many futures, many possibilities.’
        Siri falls silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘You have a part to play in the future, my friend, a most important part. But what it is, I cannot say.’
        Siri smiles.
        ‘But don’t be burdened by it, the godess watches over you, and her power is vast. Now, how may I help you?’
