        From the shadows of the nightly forest, a strange whisper reaches your ears. Suddenly, small rocks and pebbles begin to stir. They 
        unearth themselves from the forest floor, and roll together. They merge and join, forming a distinct shape.

        A large wolf stands before you. It is entirely composed of rocks and stones. Its eyes are two black pebbles. It growls. You hear a deep 
        vibrating sound, as of rocks grating against each other.

    <p>
        The wolf opens wide its maw, filled with rocky teeth, and attacks.

        The Rockwolf jumps at you for a killing blow, but with speed and agility, you dodge its attack. Then, you counter attack with all your
        might. The wolf is thrown unto the ground. It lies very still. Then, a violent quake stirs the wolfs body. Before your eyes, the wolf
        begins to fall apart in loose pebbles and rocks.
