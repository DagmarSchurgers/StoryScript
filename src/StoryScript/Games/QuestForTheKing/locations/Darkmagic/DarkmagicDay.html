        Suddenly, the forest becomes very dark. Through the forest canopy, you can see a dark cloud passing before the sun. It starts to rain. 
        Heavy raindrops fall down through the canopy. The rain increase, becoming a shroud of falling water.
        Suddenly, you hear a strange whisper. It echoes from somewhere deep within the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
        You see something within the shroud of rain. A silhouette composed entirely of water droplets. The silhouette begins to move, taking a 
        step towards you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You look upon a mirror images of yourselfs. A reflection created from droplets of water, carrying translucent weapons and armour. 
        Exact copies of the weapon in your hands and the armour on your body.
        Without sound, the mirror image unsheathes its weapons, and quickly moves to attack.

        You drive back your mirror image, besting yourself in strength and magic. As you strike with a final, mighty blow, your mirror image
        disintegrates. Its silhouette falls apart, in a spray of water droplets across the forest floor.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rain begins to cease. The dark cloud begins to pass away from the sun, and soon the sunlight falls again in golden beams through the 
        forest canopy.
