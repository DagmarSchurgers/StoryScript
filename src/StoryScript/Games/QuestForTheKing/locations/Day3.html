        It is the third day of the tournament. The list of entrants is thinning rapidly, only a few warriors remain. Although the experience of the
        previous night has left you a bit shaken, you rise with determination to fight, and win the day.

        Upon the tournament field, the spectators have already taken their place upon the benches. Among them, one rises up and waves enthousiastically at you. You
        recognize Bjarni, and next to him, looking up to him and smiling, sits Siri. She turns her eyes to you and raises her hand in greetings.
        But then, your opponent enter the field.

    <p>
        Your next opponent emerges from a blue silken tent, embroidered with intricate designs in a silver thread.  You see an attractive young women take to the field,
        clad in a partial plate mail and a silver, winged helm. In her hands she holds a spears and wooden shield. Clearly, the woman is a shieldmaiden from the
        Valkyrian order.

    <p>
        As the shieldmaiden strides unto the field, she looks looks at you inquisitively with radiant blue eyes. She is quite beautiful, with long golden hair falling down
        from under her helmet. She takes a short bow before you.
        ‘I salute you, brother. May Odin bless us all and the Valkyries watch over our duel.’
        Her voice is soft but with a firmness and determination to it. She will undoubtedly be a strong adversary.

        On the great wooden stage the king's steward rises, and casts the wooden rod upon the field. Your second battle has begun.

        The young woman falls back before your might. Her shield is splinterd, her spear on the verge of breaking and her armor is cut in several places.
        As you make ready for your next attack, she suddenly raises her spear to the sky, and then lays it carefully on the ground. She gives you a respectful nod.
        'You have defeated me, brother,' she speaks softly.
        ‘You clearly are a great warrior, and Odin has blessed you.’

    </p>
    <p>

        As the young woman retreats to her tent, the spectators, who have watched your battle with intensity and cries of awe, rise from their benches and give you a long
        and enthousiastic applause.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the wooden stage the king’s steward descends, and walks towards you.
        ‘A fine performance, warrior. Here is your reward for your third victory.’
        The steward hands you a leather pouch, containing 30 gold coins.
