        The sister of the moon is the youngest of the three sacred sisters, and the most enigmatic. Worshipers of the moon goddess are usually 
        wizards, magicians and soothsayers. But she is also revered amongst those who make a living in the shadows, thieves, rogues and other 
        persons of questionable morality.

        The sister of the moon is neutral in such matters, it is said, and has an agenda of her own. She is the youngest of the three sisters and 
        has the smallest domain. As such, her sisters sometimes treat her in a patronizing manner, but she is much more than she appears.
        I have been told the moon sister communicates with her worshipers through rays of moonlight, in which a soft whisper can be heard, for 
        those who hear and listen.

        The sister of the moon is depicted as a beautiful young woman with a finely chiseled face. Her black hair is bound together at the back of 
        her head, and held fast with silvery pins. She is dressed in a long, silvery dress, embroidered with images of the moon and stars, with a 
        broad blue sash around her waist.

        I have heard a rumor that there is an order of female warriors fiercely loyal to the moon sister. Strange stories are told about the order, 
        that the female members are not human, not anymore, that they have crossed into a shadowy existence. But most stories connect the order with
        acts of protection and vigilance, and the death of those who would harm the innocent in a most gruesome manner. Gruesome, I must say, for it
        appears that, when they where found, all their blood had been mysteriously drained from their bodies.

        The moon sister is a mystery, and I have to say, that she is the goddess that intrigues me the most.
