        Of course, the gods of the old country are worshiped, such as Odin, Tyr and Freya. But also gods that where revered long before the warriors
        of king Vali made landfall. Or rather, goddesses I should say, for the native peoples of Idunia revere three goddesses, sacred sisters, as 
        they are called. The Sister of the Sea, the Sister of the Sky and the Sister of the moon.
