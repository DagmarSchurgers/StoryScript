        You come upon a forest clearing. In the centre several beautiful flowers grow. They are of a delicate, violet hue, resembling wild forest 
        lilies. The flowers glisten in the sun with an iridescent quality. A potent flowery scent permeates the area, much stronger then you would 
        have expected from such small fragile flowers.

        But in front of the flower stands a huge, brown bear. It sniffs at the flowers and seems to find them irresistible. As it detects your 
        presence, the bear suddenly turns towards you and snarls angrily. It seems determined to keep you at a distance, and the flowers to itself.

        ‘My name is Brennus, and you boys are too late.’ He grins.
        ‘I alone shall unravel the mysteries of this forest, for king Valdemar. Leave this forest and don’t return, or you must be prepared to do
        battle with me.’
        The warrior Brennus draws a large sword from a sheath at his side.
