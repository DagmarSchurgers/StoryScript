        Suddenly, you hear a strange voice. Not far from you, on a large patch of earth and mud, stands a dark figure. It is the figure of a
        man. He seems to be chanting, and moves his arms in arcane patterns.
        Before the figure, a magic circle is drawn on the ground. The circle is made from silvery dust, glittering in the moonlight.

        As you come closer, the man stops his chanting. Within the magic circle, a light fog begins to rise from the ground. The fog thickens, 
        and takes on form and features. A misty young woman appears in the centre of the circle.
        ‘Tonight, you will answer my questions, and the power will be rightfully mine’
        The voice of the man is gruff and unpleasant.
        ‘Please.’
        The young woman seems in pain. Her voice is a soft, unearthly whisper.
        ‘Please release me’.
        The man laughs harshly.
        ‘Ha, no more of your antics. Obey me, or I shall destroy you forever.’

        Suddenly, the man becomes aware of your presence. He turns swiftly towards you.
        You see a middle-aged man in a dark brown robe. He wears a black beard and moustache. His dark eyes glitter with reddish glow.
        ‘Who are you? You should not be here. This is not for your eyes.’
        The man looks at you wearily. There is something strange about him. The air around the man seems to take on an icy chill.
        ‘I am sorry, but I cannot allow you to leave. But know that your death will serve a purpose.’
        The man raises his arms. Around him, the air suddenly crackles with energy.

        The wizard stumbles back. The crackling of energy around him fades away.
        ‘You have defeated me’.
        The wizard groans.
        ‘I was so close, you cannot imagine….the power.’
        The wizard closes his eyes. He falls heavily to the ground, and moves no more.

    <p>
        Within the circle, the young woman looks at you with a smile.
        ‘Oh, thank you so much.’
        The young woman is quite beautiful. She wears a long, flowing gown of ancient fashion. Misty curls fall across her face and shoulders.
        ‘Thank you for saving me. From now on, I shall try to watch over you.’
        Her voice begins to fade away, as her form loses coherency.
        ‘Farewell, my friend.’
        The young woman is gone.
