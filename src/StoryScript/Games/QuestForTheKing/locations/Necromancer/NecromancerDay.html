        Before you, a man in a dark brown rope walks through the swamp. He seems to be collecting mushrooms and swamp herbs, picking them and 
        storing them in a small black bag. The man seems lost in thought.
        ‘Tonight’ He mutters to himself.
        ‘I shall see you again Danika, and you shall show me the power.’

        The man looks around him. He wears black beard and moustache, an ornate silver headband adorns his head.
        ‘Now where was that patch of mushrooms.’
        Suddenly, the man spots you. He looks at you with a startled look.
        ‘What? Who are you, what are you doing here?’
        The man looks at you angrily. There is something strange about him. The air around the man seems to take on an icy chill.

        The man strokes his beard.
        ‘But perhaps you might be of use. Your life force will strengthen my spell. Yes, that’s it!’
        He shakes his head at you.
        ‘I am sorry, but I cannot allow you to leave.’
        The man raises his arms. He begins to speak dark, magical words. Around him, the air suddenly crackles with energy.

        The wizard stumbles back. The crackling of energy around him fades away.
        ‘You have defeated me’.
        The wizard groans.
        ‘I was so close, you cannot imagine….the power.’
        The wizard closes his eyes. He falls heavily to the ground, and moves no more.
