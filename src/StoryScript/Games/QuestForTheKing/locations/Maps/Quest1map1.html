        After a long ride, you have arrived at the forest of Myrr. There seems to be nothing mysterious or foreboding about the forest. Beams of sunlight fall through the
        foliage of broadleaved trees, drawing golden lines across ferns and blackberry bushes. Small forest creatures scurry about on the forest floor, while woodland birds
        sing from between the branches. Somewhere in the distance, you can hear the sounds of a woodpecker.
