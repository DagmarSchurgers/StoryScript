        You have retired to your tent to sleep until the next day, when the third day of the tournament awaits you. You fall quickly asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly, a noise awakens you. Something of a branch cracking beneath a boot. All is dark around you, the only light comes from a faint ray of moonlight, falling in
        through the opening of your tent. You hear a muffled sound. Then, a whispering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Damn you. If he has heard us, the mission is lost. Come now, quick and quiet.’
        Slowly, the flap of your tent is moved aside. The moonlight illuminates two shadowy figures, holding long daggers.
        You have just the time to rise and reach for your weapons, before the figures move swiftly towards you. Battle begins!

        The shadowy figures lie defeated before you. They wear black leather clothes, their faces hidden behind black scarves. The daggers that lie in their now
        lifeless hands have a wavy blade and seem coated with a strange substance.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may take the Daggers (you gain two Poison Daggers).
        You may search the Assassins.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you search the assassins, you find an expensive looking piece of parchment, folded neatly in two. As you open it, you see it is a letter, written in
        flowing elegant letters. The letter reads:
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Your mission is this. Enter the tournament grounds at night. Find the warrior the master has warned us about, and destroy him. He must not be
        allowed to live. The master commands it.’
        The letter is unsigned.
    </p>
    <p>
        A further search of the assassins reveals a concealed leather pouch, holding 25 golden coins.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you complete your search of the strange men, you decide that leaving them dead in your tent would cause some questions to be raised.
        With effort, you take up the men, and carry them swiftly and silently out of your tent, and to the edge of the tournament field, where you hide their bodies in the
        thick underbrush.
