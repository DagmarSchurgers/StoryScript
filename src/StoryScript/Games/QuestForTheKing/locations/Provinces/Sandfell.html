        caravans heading towards the realm of sultan Mehmet the Magnificent.

        Sandfell is a rugged province, with high mountains, dark mountain valley's, mysterious forest and icy mountain streams. The people of 
        Sandfell make a living herding sheep and tending small acres of land. There are also some gold and iron mines, but the proceeds of these 
        mines is largely claimed by the crown.

        The people are generally surly and distrustful of outsiders, but fiercely loyal to each other, and capable of great outbursts of emotion. 
        They are known for their enchanting music, the notes of which are as quick as fireflies, dancing in the night. They wear colorful clothing 
        and their women adorn themselves with graceful bracelets and anklets.

        Sandfell is ruled by the sons and daughters of the mountain barons who have been killed in the great war against king Valdemar. Sandfell is
        viewed with distrust in the other provinces, and many expect that the province of Sandfell will in the future, rise once more in rebellion.
