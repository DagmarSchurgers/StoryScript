        Gelandri is the province of the best warriors of the kingdom. Not anywhere is martial prowess and courage so highly valued as among the 
        people of Gelandri. They worship their ancestors, the Norse warriors  who established the kingdom of Idunia, and Tyr, the god of war. 
        A great wooden statue of Tyr is located in the heart of the province.

        The people of Gelandri value their honor most highly, and an attack upon their honor, be it real or imagined, is met with the fiercest of 
        reactions, as I myself have had the opportunity to witness firsthand.

        Duels are frequent in Gelandri, but most of them just for sport or entertainment. And I myself have been challenged to be friendly duel more 
        then once, but I could always excuse myself by pointing to my advancing years.
