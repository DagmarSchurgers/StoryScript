        The province of Ravendal is largely abandoned, laid to waste in the great war of king Valdemar against the Wizard, and the mountain barons 
        who had chosen his side. Ravendal consists of mountains and valleys. Ruins of castles and burned down villages still recall the war and the 
        price paid by the people.

        The people still living in Ravendal move around in covered wagons and live off hunting and the crafting of woodwork and silver, in which 
        they are especially talented. Now and again, the people of Ravendal gather in valleys and fields and light great fires, around which they 
        dance and sing until the first morning light.

        The people of Ravendal refuse to feel themselves bound by the laws of the land, and their loyalty to the king is questionable at best. Like 
        their brothers and sisters of Sandfell, the people are hot tempered, emotional and very loyal to their group, but distrustful of outsiders. 
        The influence of the crown in Ravendal is limited, and comes particularly from the royal garrison, stationed  in a great fort near the border 
        with the province of Idunia.
