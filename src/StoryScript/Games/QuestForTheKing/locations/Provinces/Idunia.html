        Ah, you wish to know about the kingdom of Idunia? Please, allow me to enlighten you.
    </p>
        I have traveled through all of the provinces of the kingdom, and have spoken with noblemen, princes and princesses, dukes and duchesses. 
        But also with farmers and craftsmen, soldiers and monks. And I have written down my impressions, my adventures and experiences, in hopes 
        that others may benefit from it. Adventurers like you, for example, and it would be my honor to tell you about our great kingdom.
