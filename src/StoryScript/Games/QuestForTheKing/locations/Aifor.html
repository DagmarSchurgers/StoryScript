        The oldest and first province of the kingdom of Idunia is the province of Aifor. It is the province where the forefathers of king Vali 
        went ashore.

        The province of Aifor consists largely of pine woods. Villages are scattered and far apart, and keep contact with signal fires that are lit 
        on the hills within the forest, and with trained falcons, which carry messages with speed. As such, falconers are viewed with great respect 
        in Aifor, as many villagers depend on them for messages from their relatives.

        Aifor is ruled by duke Erland, a closed, absent minded man. A dreamer, it is said, whose thoughts are more with his books than his province.
        The daily matters of the province are therefore handled by his wife, the countess Thyra, the most beautiful women of the kingdom, it is said.
        The countess Thyra is also the leader of a group of female druids, who worship the forest goddess Embla.
        The druids are aided, it is said, by mesmerizing dryads and nymphs of the woods, and their rituals take place in the deepest, most confined
        spaces of the forest.
