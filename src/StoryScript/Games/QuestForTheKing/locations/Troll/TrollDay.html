        You come upon a small forest hillock. On the top grows a large oak tree. In the shade of the tree lies a huge creature. It has a green 
        skin, large bulging arms and legs, and is clad in a dirty leather loincloth.
        The creature has a face of surpassing ugliness. A large crooked nose bends over an uneven mouth from which two yellowish fangs protrude.
        Dirty strands of blackish hair fall across its forehead and temples.
        The creature seems fast asleep, and produces a monstrous snoring sound which echoes through the quiet of the forest.

        From one of the branches of the tree on the hillock hangs an iron cage. Within it, you can see several small, butterfly-like creatures 
        flutter about. The creatures have noticed you too, and suddenly begin to shriek with high pitched voices. You can discern something 
        along the lines of:’Help us. Save us from the beast.’

        The ‘beast’ in the shade of the tree slowly opens an eye. As it sees you, it suddenly springs to its feet, grasping a huge oaken club 
        that had been lying in the grass.
        ‘You want steal pretty butterflies?’ it asks with a deep, slurred voice.
        ‘Me make you go away good.’
        The next moment it lunges at you with its huge oaken club.

        The Troll staggers back. Wounded and with eyes wide open.
        ‘Oi! You strong! Me not fight you! Me run away!’
        The Troll drops his cudgel and turns swiftly. With huge, ground shaking steps it runs down the side of the hillock and disappears 
        into the forest.
