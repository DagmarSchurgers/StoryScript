        You come upon a small forest hillock, lit by the light of a full moon. On the top grows a large oak tree. In the shadow of the tree sits a 
        huge creature. It has a green skin, large bulging arms and legs, and is clad in a dirty leather loincloth.
        The creature has a face of surpassing ugliness. A large crooked nose bends over an uneven mouth from which two yellowish fangs protrude. 
        Dirty strands of blackish hair fall across its forehead and temples.

        The creature holds an iron cage in its hands, and seems to talk to whatever it has caught within it.
        ‘Sing, faeries.’ It speaks with a deep, slurred voice.
        ‘You sing now.’
        Within the cage you see several small, butterfly-like creatures flutter about, shrieking with high pitched voices. They seem to be in 
        mortal terror. The creature places one of its flabby ears against the cage, and then rattles it violently.
        ‘Hmmm, me hear nothing. Stupid faeries.’

        Suddenly, the creature notices you.
        ‘Hey, who you?’ it proclaims.
        ‘You want steal pretty butterflies? Me make you go away good.’
        The next moment, the creature drops the iron cage and lifts a huge oaken club from the grass.

        The Troll staggers back. Wounded and with eyes wide open.
        ‘Oi! You strong! Me not fight you! Me run away!’
        The Troll drops his cudgel and turns swiftly. With huge, ground shaking steps it runs down the side of the hillock and disappears 
        into the forest.
