        As you approach the tent, you can hear some faint voices coming from within. Suddenly, some dried twigs crack beneath your boots. Within the tent the voices 
        immediately stop.

        ‘Wait’ a deep male voice exclaims.
        ‘Did you hear something?’
    </p>
    <p>
        You hear heavy footsteps approaching the flap of the tent. The next moment, the tent flap is cast aside. A large warrior stands in the opening, clad in heavy plate 
        mail. He wears a black beard and moustache, a large scar runs down his left cheek.

        ‘What’s this? Assassins come to murder me in the night? I’ll kill you for your dishonour.’
        The warrior draws a large sword from a scabbard at his side.
