        As you produce the magic flower, a smile glides across the queen bee’s face. Her green eyes seem to sparkle with joy.
        ‘We knew you would succeed. Now we can create the honey, and save our brave warrior. As for your reward, take this.’
        One of the guards steps forward and presents you with a scabbard of yellow leather, from which protrudes the black hilt of a sword.
        ‘Use it well’ speaks the queen bee.
        ‘And may you vanquish the evil within the forest.’
