    You come upon a large brown tent of thick leather. From a improvised chimney, columns of thick black smoke rise up. From the inside of the tent comes the sound of 
    a loud clanging and banging, of hammering, the sizzling of hot steel and the wheezing of bellows. A great heat emanates from the tent.

        As you approach, the noises stop, and from the opening of the tent appears a large, burly man, clad in a leather apron stained with sooth and ash. The man has a black
        beard and moustache and brown eyes with which he looks at you curiously.

        ‘Ah, you must be that young adventurer. I have heard about you. It seems you have great skill for a youngster such as yourself.’
        The man smiles merrily.
        ‘Well, I wish you all the best in the tournament. If you need weapons or armor, or some repairs done, come visit me.’
        The man sits down upon a wooden stool in front of the tent and takes a pipe from of the pockets of his apron.
        ‘My name is Bjarni by the way, glad to have met you.
