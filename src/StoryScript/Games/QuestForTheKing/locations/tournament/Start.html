        You have entered the famous great tournament to become the new  Royal Adventurer of the kingdom of Idunia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is the first day of the tournament. You stand in the centre of the tournament field, surrounded by colourful tents and pavilions, bearing the banners of all
        participating warriors. Between the tents, on long wooden benches, sit men and women, farmers and craftsmen, spectators from all  corners of the kingdom.

    <p>
        Next to you on the field stand your opponents, all the warriors with a desire to become the new royal adventurer of Idunia. You see archers and spearmen,
        berserkers from the province of Gelandri, knifedancers from the mountains of Ravendal, and knights clad in full armor.
        Before you, at the far end of the field, rises a wooden stage, decorated with shields and flags of all the provinces of Idunia. On the stage sits king Valdemar
        on a wooden throne, surrounded by his royal advisors. The king rises from his throne, and the murmur of the crowd ebbs away.

        ‘Warriors’ speaks the king, in a pleasant, low voice.
        ‘You have gathered here today to participate in a great event. A great tournament, in which you will do battle to prove yourself worthy of the title of royal
        adventurer of Idunia. I wish you all the best and may Odin be with you.’<br />
        The king raises his hand in salute, and then takes his place upon the throne. The  warriors upon the field disperse, and as you follow them to the edge of the
        field, you see that two warrior remain, facing off against each other.

        On the wooden stage, the kings steward comes forward. He holds out a wooden rod, and after a moment of silence, cast it upon the field. The two warriors
        engage each other. The first day of the tournament has begun.
