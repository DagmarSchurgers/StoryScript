        You arrive at one of the more remote corners of the tournament field. Before you stands a yellow tent. The tent is of a very expensive looking fabric, 
        which glitters in the sunlight. Now and again, a ripple of light seems to pass through the fabric, as if it absorbed the sunlight, and it is trickling down 
        towards the ground. The top of the tent is a small, golden cupola, made of gold foil it seems, and decorated with strange, calligraphic words in a language 
        unknown to you.

        Before the tent stands a wooden table and behind it, on a an expensive looking wooden chair, sits a middle-aged man. The man has a graying beard and mustache, 
        and brown eyes. He wears a long sleeved white shirt, and a red leather jacket. His head is partially covered by the hood of a black cloak.
        The man seems to be scribbling something on a piece of parchment, and is mumbling softly to himself. He seems to be wholly unaware of your presence.

        As you make your presence know, the man looks up with a start. He peers at you, squinting his eyes.
        'Oh, ah, I'm sorry. I did not hear you approach.'
        The man has a melodious low voice.
        'But where are my manners, by Tyr's lost hand, I am getting to be quite the old fool.'
        The man smiles at you.

        'Let me introduce myself. I am Fasold, traveler and storyteller, and you are one of the contestants in the tournament, are you not? How very kind of you to visit me. 
        I am here for posterity you see, to document the tournament and all the fights, and give a a true and honest account of all what happens here.'
        The man points to the parchment before him.
        'I have just started my account, and anything you can tell me about yourself and the tournament would be most appreciated.  And feel free to ask me any questions 
        you like. I have traveled far and wide, and seen many strange and magical places and can tell you a lot about the history of the kingdom of Idunia. '
