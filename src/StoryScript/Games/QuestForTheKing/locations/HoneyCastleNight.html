        Before you lies an island meadow. The meadow is full of flowers of all colours, shapes and sizes, growing wild. Here and there, between the 
        flowers, blossoming fruit trees cast their shade. Most of the flowers have closed their petals. Some silvery flowers have opened in the 
        moonlight however, and permeate the air with a flowery scent.
        There is a small path running through the flowers. Evidence that the island might not be deserted.

        As you walk down the small path, a feeling of relaxation spreads through your body. The quietness of the nightly garden, the moonlight 
        across the flowers and trees, fills your thoughts with dreaminess and a desire to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        A feeling which suddenly vanishes, as you spot a strange castle in the distance.

        You may Approach the castle or leave.
