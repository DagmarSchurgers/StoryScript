        You remain still, and watch the shadow move alongside the ship. Suddenly, it opens an eye. A huge, green eye, glistening in the moonlight.
        You stay motionless and very still, careful not to attract its the attention.
        Then, the eye closes again, and the huge shadow moves slowly out of sight.

        Not before long, a light gust of wind suddenly stirs the sail, as if the passing of the shadow has also brought back the wind. The wind
        picks up and soon you feel the ship begin to move again, as the white sail begins to swell and billow.
