        As you sail across the ocean waves, the wind begins to drop. The sail flutters and falls powerless against the mast. The ship comes slowly 
        to a halt. Around you, the vast ocean becomes very quiet. The smooth surface mirrors the star filled sky.
        Suddenly, you spot a dark shadow passing beneath the ship. A huge shadow, easily as big as the ship.
