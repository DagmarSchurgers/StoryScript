        You enter a shadowy hallway. It is build out of several rounded, interconnecting chambers, like the cells in a beehive. The air within the 
        hallway is permeated with the sweet fragrance of honey. As you move further down the hallway, it begins to widen, until you reach a large, 
        rounded throneroom.

        The throne room is lit by bronze candelabra’s standing next to the walls. There are several hexagonal openings in the walls, from which 
        man-sized bees fly to and fro.
        In the centre of the throneroom, you see a majestic looking creature. A queen bee, sitting on a waxen throne. The queen bee is clad in a 
        gossamer gown that falls down her body with a silken thread. On her head, just above the antennae, rests a small golden crown.
        Guards on either side of the throne, clad in chain mail and with long halberds, seem to watch you closely.


        As you approach the castle, the bee guards remain still and unmoving. But you can discern, from an almost unnoticeable tensing of their
        bodies, that they are very much aware of you. Their large insect eyes follow you with a flicker of intelligence.

        ‘Welcome adventurers’.
        The queen bee hails you with a deep reverberating voice. Resembling a buzzing sound, as of many small wings fluttering simultaneously.
        ‘I am glad you have arrived. The best of our warriors lies mortally wounded. Defeated by the darkness of the forest he sought to destroy. 
        There is only one way to save him.’
        The queen bee looks at you with her green, many faceted eyes.
        ‘There is a flower, growing somewhere in the forest. A magical flower, which we may use to create a magical honey. Honey which has the power 
        to heal the most grievous of wounds. Help us. Retrieve the flower and bring it here, and we will reward you well.’
