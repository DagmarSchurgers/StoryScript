        As you move through the forest, you have the sensation of being watched. But there is no one there. As you travel further, the 
        sensation intensifies.

    <p>
        From the corners of your eyes, you see silhouettes of strange faces appear in the bark of the trees. Gnarled branches extend into 
        grasping arms. But as you turn, there is nothing there.
        Then, suddenly, the trees in front of you bend over. They grasp at each other with their branches, and intertwine them. The path before 
        you is utterly blocked.
