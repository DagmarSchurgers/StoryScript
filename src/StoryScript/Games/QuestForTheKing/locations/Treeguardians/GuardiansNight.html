        As you move through the forest, you suddenly have the sensation of being watched. But there is no one there. You notice that the forest 
        has become very quiet. The crickets and night birds have fallen silent.

        As you travel further, the sensation intensifies. From the corners of your eyes, you see silhouettes of faces appear in the bark of the 
        trees. Gnarled branches extend into grasping arms. But as you turn, there is nothing there.
        Suddenly, the trees in front of you bend over, grasping at each other with their branches, and intertwining them. The path before you is
        utterly blocked.
