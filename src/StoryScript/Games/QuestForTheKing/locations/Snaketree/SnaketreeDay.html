        Before you, an old crooked tree rises from the swamp. There is something strange about the tree. Some of its branches move and twist 
        with snakelike animation. As you come closer, you detect the nature of the animated branches. Snakes, large and of a dark green colour, 
        writhing and coiling within the tree’s canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below the canopy, a strange dagger has been trust into the stem of the tree. It seems of ancient design, but strangely untouched by the 
        corroding power of the swamp. An indication of its perhaps magical nature.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not far from the tree, you see the skeletal remains of an adventurer. Perhaps the previous, and unlucky, owner of the dagger. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You may try to take the dagger or leave.
