        As you reach for the dagger, one of the snakes in the tree canopy reacts with blinding speed. It lashes out at you, with opened maw 
        and fangs dripping with poison.

        Success! You deftly avoid the striking snake, moving your body out of its path. At the same time, you quickly grasp the dagger and pull 
        it from the tree’s stem. Before any of the other snakes can attack, you quickly withdraw.

        Failed! You fail to dodge the snake’s attack, and feel its poison fangs sink into your body. Almost immediately, a wave of nausea washes 
        over you.

        You are free of the poison!

        Failed! Unchecked, the poison courses through your system. The feeling of nausea grows in intensity, you  feel your limbs grow numb, 
        your mind darkens. The world shifts out of joint. You fall heavily on the ground. Your adventuring days are at an end.
