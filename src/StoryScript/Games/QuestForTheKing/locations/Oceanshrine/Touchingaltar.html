        You reach out your hands and touch the altar. As you do so, a sudden warmth flows through you. You feel much better. Warm and almost 
        weightless, as if, for a moment, all the weight and worries of the world have been lifted from your shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are fully healed.

        You feel the presence of magic. Benevolent magic, coming from the altar. But you detect another presence as well. Just before the altar, 
        beneath your feet. You take a step back, and observe that one of the marble stones before the altar seems loose.

    <p>
        As you remove the stone, you see a small cavity, and within it, a small leather bag. You open the bag, and find a silver ring, adorned 
        with a large ruby. The ring glows up in your hands with a fiery light.
