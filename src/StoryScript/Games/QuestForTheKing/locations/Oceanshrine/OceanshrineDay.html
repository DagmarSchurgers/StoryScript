        You reach a small, rocky island. In the centre you can see a small, silvery pavilion. Silver wind chimes hang down from the ceiling and 
        produce a faint tingling sound.

        In the centre of the pavilion stands an altar of white marble. The altar is decorated with images of hazy and translucent women. 
        The women seem to fly or float, weightless and unearthly, as fairies or water sprites.

        As you approach, the music of the wind chimes suddenly changes. It becomes more melodious and seems to tingle around you, like small
        sparkles in the sunlight.
        You feel as if the music pushes you gently towards the altar. As you come closer, a golden glow seems to spread across its surface.

        You may touch the altar or leave.
