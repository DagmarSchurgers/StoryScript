        The province of Lysa is largely covered with swamps. I have been there only a few times myself, but I always been surprised by the peace and 
        contentment of the people, even though Lysa is the poorest province of the kingdom.
        It is said, that the peace and quiet of the people also stems from a certain swamp root, that is consumed in great quantities, and appears 
        to bring about a particular state of mind. But I have never been able to verify this.

        Lysa is ruled by the countess Ruzena. A mysterious woman, beautiful, but cold blooded and opaque, like the water of the swamps. Elusive, 
        it is said, like the mists that cover the swamps of Lysa for a great part of the year.

        The countess has a reputation of friendliness and kindness to her subjects, but no one exactly knows what drives her, and some suspect her 
        of more sinister motivations. Her castle, to be sure, is a sight to behold. It is build from blue, transparent stone, a sort of glassy rock,
        that is only dug up in Lysa, and glitters and shines in the rays of the sun.
