        You arrive at a clearing in the forest. In the middle of the clearing stands a large blue tent. Before the tent an old, grey-haired man
        wearing a leather apron is busy repairing a long sword upon an anvil. His blows with a heavy hammer upon the anvil echo through the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you come closer, the man stops his repairs.
        ‘More adventurers’ he mutters wearily. He puts down his hammer on the anvil and disappears into the blue tent. A moment later, a large
        warrior emerges, clad in shining plate mail. He wears a thick black beard and moustache, a seemingly fresh scar runs down his left cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘My name is Brennus, and you boys are too late.’ He grins.
        ‘I alone shall unravel the mysteries of this forest, for king Valdemar. Leave this forest and don’t return, or you must be prepared to do
        battle with me.’
        The warrior Brennus draws a large sword from a sheath at his side.

        You arrive at a clearing in the forest. In the middle of the clearing, illuminated by the moonlight, stands a large tent.
        The flap of the tent has been closed, though underneath it, some faint light protrudes.

            With a groan of pain, Brennus falls heavily to the ground. After some moments, he manages to raise himself a bit, resting on the pommel of
            his sword.

        <p>
            ‘Alas, you have defeated me. Well, you did good, and I suppose you are the better warrior. I leave it to you then, to complete the quest of
            the king.’
            Brennus raises his hand in a salute.
            ‘Off with you lad, your adventure awaits.’

        With a groan of pain, Brennus falls heavily to the ground. After some moments, he manages to raise himself a bit, resting on the pommel
        of his sword.
        ‘And so the mighty Brennus is defeated. By thugs and mercenaries in the bleak of the night. Well, have at it then, end the days of the
        mighty Brennus.’
    </p>
    <p>
        As you stand back, and allow Brennus to rise slowly and painfully to his feet, and even offer him the support of your arm, he eyes you
        with
        renewed interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘So, not likely to be criminals,  you are. Perhaps I misjudged you. Perhaps you are good folk. Well, defeated me you have, and as you
        are fellow adventures, from the looks of it, you too are probably on the quest for the king.  You have bested me, so it is all yours.’
        Brennus raises his hand in a salute.
        ‘Now off with you lad, your adventure awaits.
