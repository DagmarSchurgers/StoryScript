        You feel the music flowing past and around you. As if touching you with golden strands of light. It seems to stirr something deep inside 
        you, a distant memory. But you fight it, you push back the memory and drive the music from your thoughts.

        As you do so, the man on the treestump gives you a worried glance. As if guilty of something. You can see he is about to make a run for 
        it.
