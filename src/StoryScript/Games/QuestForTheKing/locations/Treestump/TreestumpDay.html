        From the depths of the forest, a haunting melody reaches your ears. As you come closer, you spot a strange creature, sitting on a tree 
        stump in the shade of a large oak. The creature looks like a man, but has two curled horns on his head and his legs are those of a large 
        goat. He wears nothing but a green loincloth, a thick, goat like brown fur covers his body.

        The creature is playing a reed flute, his fingers dart across the little holes and an intricate melody rises up. The music seems to 
        drift towards you. Flowing, like rays of sunlight, glittering across the grass and the trees as it passes.
