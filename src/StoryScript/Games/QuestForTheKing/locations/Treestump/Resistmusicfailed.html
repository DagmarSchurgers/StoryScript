        You feel the music flowing past and around you.. As if touching you with golden strands of light.A great relaxation spread through your 
        bodies. The music seems to awaken something inside of you. Ancient memories, of sunlit plains, golden palaces, waterfalls and lakes of 
        crystal clear water. You hear the echoes of laughter, feminine voices calling out in joy. A great longing sweeps through you, for 
        something that once was, but has been lost long ago.

        Then, the music subsides. You did not notice the strange man rising from his tree stump, or approaching you, but suddenly, he stands 
        before you, and takes a deep bow. Then, quickly, he darts passed you, and into the forest.

    <p>
        It takes you several minutes to shake the effects of the strange music, and to notice, that half of your gold has mysteriously vanished.
