        You return to your tents amidst great cheer and applause. You rest until night falls, and rise to return to the tournament field.
        The field has changed greatly. Long benches and tables are placed upon it, carrying all kinds of food and drink. Lanterns are placed in the trees surrounding
        the field, and a special stage on which musicians perform has been erected in the centre.

    A great crowd of people has gathered upon the field, people from all walks of life, craftsmen and farmers, nobleman and soldiers.
    All look up to the king’s stage, where king Valdemar stands in his ceremonial armour. The king motions all to be silent.
    ‘Today, my people, we have seen a new hero emerge from the fires of battle, steeled and hardened, he defeated one of my best knights. He has earned for himself 
    the title of Royal Adventurer of Idunia, soldier and protector of the people. 
    Now, my friends, let us honour him, and celebrate his victory. Let the feast begin!’
    </p>

        The night unfolds in great merryment and celebration. You are applauded and congratulated by many, and humbly asked by many to join them on the benches, for a
        toast and a sharing of your experiences. Siri and Bjarni approach to congratulate you. Bjarni giving you such an enthousiastic handshake that you fear the
        dislodging of your arm, while Siri plants a kiss on your cheeks, which seems to remain there, glowing and soft, for the remainder of the evening.

        As the night wanes and the dawn approaches, you retire to your bed. For tomorrow, the king will summon you for your first quest, as the new Royal Adventurer of Idunia.
