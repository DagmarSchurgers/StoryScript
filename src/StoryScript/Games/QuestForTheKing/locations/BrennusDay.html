        You arrive at a clearing in the forest. In the middle of the clearing stands a large blue tent. Before the tent an old, grey-haired man wearing a leather apron is 
        busy repairing a long sword upon an anvil. His blows with a heavy hammer upon the anvil echo through the forest.

        As you come closer, the man stops his repairs.
        ‘More adventurers’ he mutters wearily. He puts down his hammer on the anvil and disappears into the blue tent. A moment later, a large warrior emerges, clad in 
        shining plate mail. He wears a thick black beard and moustache, a seemingly fresh scar runs down his left cheek.

        ‘My name is Brennus, and you boys are too late.’ He grins.
        ‘I alone shall unravel the mysteries of this forest, for king Valdemar. Leave this forest and don’t return, or you must be prepared to do battle with me.’
        The warrior Brennus draws a large sword from a sheath at his side.
