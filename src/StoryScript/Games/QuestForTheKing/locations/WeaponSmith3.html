        As you arrive at the tent, you see Bjarni talking to two royal officers.  The officers seem to be asking him several questions, to which Bjarni replies 
        by shaking his head and raising his shoulders.

        After a moment, the officers take their leave, and Bjarni turns towards you.
        ‘Ah, friend, good you are here. Seems there has been some excitement last night. They have found the bodies of two men. Assassins, it would seem. At least,
        that is what the officers told me.’
        Bjarni looks at you with interest.
        ‘But what they where after, has apparently got the better of them. At any rate, good riddance to the scum I say. Now, how can I help you?’
