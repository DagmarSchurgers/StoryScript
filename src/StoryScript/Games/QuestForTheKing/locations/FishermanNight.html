        Before you lies a sandy beach, and beyond the beach, a vast ocean. Its unquiet surface glistens with reflections of the moon and stars. 
        A gentle surf ebbs and flows across the sand.

        Not far from the edge of the forest, you can see a small cottage. It is raised from the beach on sturdy wooden posts. A wooden porch extends
        from the cottage across the beach, and into the sea as a short pier.
        The door to the cottage is closed and the window shutters have been drawn shut. Whoever lives here seems to have retired for the night.

        At the end of the pier you can spot the dark shape of a boat.
