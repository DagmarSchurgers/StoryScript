        As you cut the old net away, the creature opens her eyes to you. Beautiful blue eyes, sparkling with little points of light, like the sun 
        on an unquiet sea.

        You remove the last remnants of the old net, and as you do so, she smiles a beautiful smile. With a gentle movement of her tail, she pushes 
        herself from the beach and into the ocean surf.  She quickly disappears.

        You stare across the glistening surface of the sea, wondering where the strange and beautiful creature went. Then, a strange whisper seems 
        to reach your ears, embedded within the rustling of the ocean surf.
        ‘Thank you for helping me’.
        A large clamshell floats towards the beach. It is taken up by the surf and pushed unto the sand. It opens out of itself, revealing a large, 
        shiny pearl.
