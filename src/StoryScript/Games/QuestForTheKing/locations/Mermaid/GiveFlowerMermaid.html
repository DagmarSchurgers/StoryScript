        intently. The flower, meanwhile, starts to glow with a misty blue light.

        A large clamshell floats towards the beach. It is taken up by the surf and pushed unto the sand. It opens out of itself, revealing a large, 
        shiny pearl.
        A soft whisper seems to reach your ears, embedded within the rustling of the ocean surf.
        ‘Thank you for the beautiful flower’.
