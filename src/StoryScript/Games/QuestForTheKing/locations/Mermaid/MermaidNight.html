        You have reached a sandy beach. A gentle surf ebbs and flows across the sand and beyond it lies a vast, silvery ocean. It is very quiet. 
        Only the breaking of the surf can be heard, and the rustling of the sea wind.

        A strange glittering catches your attention, just beneath the surface of the water.Suddenly, a large fishtail emerges from the water, 
        glistening in the moonlight. The fishtail seems very delicate, ending in a translucent, veil like fan.

        The fishtail submerges beneath the water again, but in its place, some distance from where it vanished, long green curls rise up from 
        beneath the surface, flowing in the ocean waves.
        The curls are followed by the beautiful face of a young girl. She has large blue eyes, mirroring the starlit sky. She studies you silently.
