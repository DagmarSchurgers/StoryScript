        The sister of the sea is a fickle goddess, or so I have heard. Sometimes kind and gentle, but also tempestuous and wild, and vengeful 
        against any who have offended her. An elusive goddess, it is said, as fathomless as the deepest sea.

        The people who worship her, fisherman and merchants, try to gain her favor before they sail, offering her incense and precious stones,
        which they send out unto the sea upon small boats made of parchment. But all sailors know the temper of the sister of the sea is fickle,
        and can easily shift and change.

        The sister of the sea is depicted as a pale but beautiful young woman, clad in a blue dress with a pattern of fish scales, adorned with white
        shells. She has long green curls, and misty eyes, like the fog upon the sea.
        She sits on a throne of red coral, and around the throne lie the coils of a huge sea dragon. The dragon is blue scaled, and has silvery manes
        like that of a lion. It is said the dragon is the messenger and companion of the sister of the sea.

        Mariners sometimes claim to have seen the dragon, coiling in the depths of great whirlpools, or in the foam of huge waves of an especially
        tempestuous sea. The dragon itself is also revered, but as a minor deity.
