        Before you lies an island meadow. The meadow is full of flowers of all colours, shapes and sizes, growing wild. Here and there, between the 
        flowers, blossoming fruit trees cast their shade.

    <p>
        The air is permeated with a flowery scent, and stirs with the movement of small insects flying from flower to flower. There is a small path 
        running through the flowers. Evidence that the island might not be deserted.

        As you walk down the small path, a light drowsiness overcomes you. The sight of the colourful flowers, the glistening sunlight, the lazy 
        movements of the insects and the heady perfume, instils a feeling of relaxation and dreaminess within you.
    </p>
    <p>
        A feeling which suddenly vanishes, as you spot a strange castle in the distance.

        You may Approach the castle or leave.
