        Before you, from the swamp water, rises a single oak tree. Some of its branches have broken off and parts of its bark have peeled away. 
        It seems sickly and weak.

    <p>
        Suddenly, a large portion of the bark of the tree suddenly cracks and stirs. Before your eyes, it reforms itself into the shape 
        of a beautiful woman. She stands before you, slender and graceful, with long green curls and coppery skin.
        But she looks unwell. There is an expression of pain in her face, of exhaustion and failing health.
        She seems to move her lips with effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Please'
        You seem to hear.
        'Please help me.’
        Her voice is like the sunlight gliding across the forest floor, like the rustling of the wind through the leaves.
        ‘The enchantress. She has cursed my pond sister. The pond dryad. She now overflows the forest with poison waters. Find her. Free her. I 
        beg of you.’
        The strange woman falls silent. Then, she seems to retreat. Her form yielding back into the tree to become the brown bark again.
