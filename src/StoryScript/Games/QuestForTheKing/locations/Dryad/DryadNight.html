        You have entered a vast swamp. A shroud of mist rises up from the surface and glitters in the moonlight. Before you, from the black, 
        muddy water, rises a single oak tree. It seems sickly and weak. Some of its branches have broken off and parts of its bark have peeled 
        away. What little leaves are left on its branches seem withered and dead.

        Not far from the tree, a mount of earth rises from the swamp. From the mount grows a single withered flower. A strange figure kneels 
        before the flower. It is the figure of a woman, slender and graceful, with long green curls and coppery skin.
        But she looks unwell, there is an expression of pain in her face, of exhaustion and failing health. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The woman carefully touches the flower with a slender finger. As she does so, her hand glows with a warm green light. Colour seems to 
        return to the flower, a light blue shade, as if  the flower is imbued with new life.
        But the woman herself closes her eyes in pain, as if the effort has drained the last of her strength.

        She rises slowly from the swamp and turns in your direction. Her eyes grow large for a moment as she spots you, but then, her face is
        illuminated by a gentle smile.
        ‘Finally, you have come’ she speaks, moving her lips with effort.
        ‘Please, please help me.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Her voice is like the moonlight gliding across the forest floor, and the rustling of the wind through the leaves.
        ‘The enchantress. She has cursed my pond sister. The pond dryad. She now overflows the forest with poison waters. Find her. Free her. I
        beg of you.’
        The woman falls silent. Then, she slowly approaches the oak tree. Her form begins to yield into the tree, becoming part of its bark and
        stem.
