        Before you, the Dryad emerges from her tree. The swamp water around her tree has already retreated somewhat, its colour less dark and 
        muddy. The Dryad herself seems healthier as well, some colour has returned to her cheeks and she manages a faint smile.

        ‘Thank you so much, adventurer. You have broken the curse and saved my sister and me. For that, we shall be eternally grateful.’
        The Dryad reaches back into her tree, and draws forth a heavy sack.

        ‘Vile robbers buried their loot beneath my tree some while back. They were very angry when it was suddenly gone.’ She smiles.
        ‘Take it as a reward, and if you ever come by here again, please visit me.’
