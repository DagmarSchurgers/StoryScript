        Before you, the Dryad emerges from her tree. The swamp water around her tree has already retreated somewhat, its colour less dark and

        ‘Vile robbers buried their loot beneath my tree some while back. They were very angry when it was suddenly gone.’ She smiles.
        ‘Take it as a reward, and if you ever come by here again, please visit me.’
