        You have reached a sandy beach. A gentle surf ebbs and flows across the sand and beyond it glitters the blue ocean. Seagulls soar high above 
        the waves, screeching and occasionally swooping down towards the surface.

        Suddenly, not far from the beach, a huge fishtail breaks through the water’s surface. It slaps violently, creating waves and eddies. It is 
        apparently caught in some old fisherman’s net.
        The tail disappears beneath the water. A moment later, a large wave rolls towards the beach, carrying with it a strange creature.

        The creature resembles a beautiful young woman, with long golden hair and blue eyes. Instead of a woman’s legs however, she has a large 
        fishtail. The creature is wrapped in an old fisherman’s net, and seems utterly exhausted with the struggle to escape.
        The wave pushes her gently unto the beach.
