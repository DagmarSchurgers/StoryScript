        You come upon a wooden cottage, build against the stem of a large oak tree. The cottage is in a state of disrepair, the glass in its small 
        windows is broken and its walls have been overgrown by vines and creepers. The wooden door of the cottage stands widely open. Inside, you 
        can see a large oaken workbench. On the bench lies a finely crafted bow, apparently having been finished recently.

        There is also a crumbled piece of parchment, lying discarded in one of the dusty corners.
