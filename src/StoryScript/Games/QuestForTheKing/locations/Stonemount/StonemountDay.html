        You come upon a small mount of stones. The stones have been placed too orderly for it to be a natural formation. It seems to have been 
        made a long time ago, and is partially overgrown with grass and ferns.

        As you come closer, you suddenly shiver with a strange chill, as if someone touched you with icy fingers. But the feeling quickly fades 
        away again.

        Suddenly, from the corners of your eyes, you spot a swift shadow moving between the trees. Another appears between the trees on your
        other side. You hear a sudden growling sound behind you. As you turn, you are faced with two large wolfs, emerging from the forest and
        advancing towards you,  growling and with bared teeth.
