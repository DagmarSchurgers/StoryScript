        Suddenly, you hear a soft buzzing sound, as of many small wings beating rapidly. From the forest emerges a host of small, silvery 
        faeries. They fly toward the wolf and rise above it. They begin to shed little particles of golden light, that slowly descends upon the 
        wolf heads. The wolf grows angrily, but then seems to grow very weary. It lays its two heads upon his paws, and closes his eyes. The 
        wolf sinks away into a deep sleep.

        One of the small, silvery faeries flies towards you.
        ‘You have helped us, now we help you’ it seems to say, in a barely audible, tinkling voice. Then it swiftly flies away with the others, 
        disappearing into the forest.
