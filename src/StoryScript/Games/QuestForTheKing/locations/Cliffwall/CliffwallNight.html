        Before you rises a high granite cliff. At the base of the cliff you can see a dark cave. Before the cave, illuminated by the moonlight, 
        a huge, two-headed wolf is devouring the carcass of a forest deer. In the moonlight, the pelt of the wolf appears to be deep black, but 
        now and again, red lines light up, glowing with a fiery light.

        As you approach, the wolf stops eating. It raises its heads, and looks at you with large black eyes. Smoke drifts from its blood smeared 
        maws and you can feel an intense heat emanating from the two-headed wolf.

        The two-headed wolf lies defeated before you. The fiery red lines disappear from its pelt, and the smoke recedes from its maws.
        As the last of the heat emanating from the wolf disappears, you feel confident  that the guardian of the dark cave has been defeated.
