        Before you rises a high granite cliff wall. At the base of the cliff you can see a dark cave. Before the cave lies a huge, two-headed 
        wolf. The wolf has placed its heads on its paws and is fast asleep. Its pelt is a dark grey, but now and again, lines of a deep red, 
        glow up with a fiery light.

        As you approach, the wolf suddenly opens the eyes of one of its heads. It looks at you with a studious glance. Smoke drifts from its maw, you can feel an intense heat emanating from the wolf.
        As it studies you, it lazily rubs a paw across the nose of its other head, slowly awakening it. You observe that any further movement 
        towards the cave will surely cause the two-headed wolf to attack.

        The two-headed wolf lies defeated before you. The fiery red lines disappear from its pelt, and the smoke recedes from its maws.
        As the last of the heat emanating from the wolf disappears, you feel confident  that the guardian of the dark cave has been defeated.
