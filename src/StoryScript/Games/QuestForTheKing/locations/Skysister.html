        The sister of the sky is the chief goddess, the Life bringer, she is called. She brings the rain and the sunlight, and is kind-hearted and 
        benevolent. But if her anger is incurred, she becomes the goddess of raging winds and whipping rains, of thunder and lightning.

        The sister of the sky is depicted as a beautiful young woman in a white dress, embellished with golden beams like the rays of the sun, 
        or as a warrior maiden in golden armour. 
        She has long blond hair and blue eyes, blue as the clearest sky on a summer's day. She is often depicted sitting on a throne of silvery 
        clouds, with next to her a huge griffin, with radiant golden feathers.

        The sister of the sky is the eldest of the three sisters, and the other sisters obey her commands. The sister of the sea has been known to 
        rebel against her sister however, and follow her own path, regardless of the wishes of her eldest sister.

        The sister of the sky is revered by farmers, shepherds, and all that work the land. She has a special shrine in the province of Aifor, 
        where the female druids hold special celebrations and ceremonies in her honor.
