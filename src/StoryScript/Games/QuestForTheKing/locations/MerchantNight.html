        You enter a forest clearing. A colourful wagon stands in the centre of the clearing. In front of the wagon, surrounded by a circle of 
        stones, burns a small campfire. Near the fire, a figure sits huddled in a dark cloak.

        As you approach the figure raises himself from the ground. You see a middle-aged man with dark skin and black eyes. He has a black moustache 
        and short black curles.
        ‘Welcome, adventures.’
        The man bows gracefully before you.
        ‘You are in need of something, yes? I can see it in your eyes.’
        The man smiles, bearing a number of gold teeth.

        ‘And whatever you need, friends, I can provide. Weapons and armour. Swords and bows of the highest quality. And magic items. Strange, 
        mysterious items of such power as to be found nowhere else. Oh, and I can teach you a skill or two, if you are of a certain profession.’
        The man grins, and awaits your choice.
