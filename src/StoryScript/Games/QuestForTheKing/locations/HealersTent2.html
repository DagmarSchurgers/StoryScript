    As you come upon the healers tent, you hear singing coming from within. Then, the singing stops, and you hear the friendly voice of Siri.

    </p>

    ‘Warrior, I have been expecting you. Please, come in.’


    <p>

    You enter the tent and see Siri stirring something in a large bowl of water on a stone pedestal. The air in her tent is warm and filled with the scents of spices
    and herbs.  Herbs hang down from the ceiling of the tent, and are stored in jars and small pots upon wooden tables. Sunlight falls in through small circular 
    windows in the fabric of the tent, falling in golden beams across a tapestry of blue and green that covers the floor. 

    </p>

    As you enter, Siri turns towards you and smiles brightly. Her smile is quite radiant, rivalling the golden beams of sunlight.
    ‘Welcome, warrior. I saw you fight yesterday. I was worried for you more than once, but you won the day with bravery. It must be quite exciting to stand in 
    the midst of battle, as you do. But please, how may I aid you?’
